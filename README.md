### The readme file describes briefly how run_analysis.R script works 

* Download and unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "data".
* The "data" folder and run_analysis.R script should be in the same working directory in order for the script to work.
* Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 
* The script generates two output files in the current working directory:
  - merged_data.txt (7.9 Mb): Contains a data frame called cleanedData, 10299*68 in size.
  - tidy_data_with_means.txt (220 Kb): Contains a data frame called tidy, 180*68 in size.
